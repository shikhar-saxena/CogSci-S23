- Top-down: We infer about a large object (without going into the granular details).
    - Our experiences and memories for example
    - In auditory and visual perception (example through auditory and visual illusions)
    - Bistable perception: Observing two things in the same thing. In illusion.
- Bottom-up: We infer from smaller details about a large object. (like CNN layers).
    
# Big Questions (in Cog Sci)

- How are we able to rapidly process and interpret external info?
- How do all our sensations unify into a seamless unified experience of the world? - **the binding problem**
- How do we form and retrieve memories?
- Storing memories in synapses (serve analogous to weights in NNs)

How much is early-order perception (perception of lines, shapes etc.) penetrated by cognition (higher order perception)? One of the debates.
